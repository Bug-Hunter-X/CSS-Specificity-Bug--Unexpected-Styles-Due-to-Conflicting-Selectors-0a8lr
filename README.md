# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in CSS related to selector specificity.  The bug occurs when two or more CSS rules have the same specificity and conflict with each other.  The order of rules in your stylesheet then unexpectedly dictates the outcome.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is that the CSS engine's resolution of equal specificity conflicts is not always intuitive. Developers might assume rules are processed from top to bottom, but this is not guaranteed to resolve the conflict.  Understanding specificity in depth is crucial to avoid such bugs.

## Solution

The best approach is to carefully review CSS rules, ensure that specificity is used correctly, and that rules do not conflict.  When faced with conflicting specificity, the order of stylesheets can affect the outcome and tools like browser developer tools can aid in identifying problematic selectors. Tools like Chrome Devtools can assist in pinpointing the source of conflicting CSS rules.
