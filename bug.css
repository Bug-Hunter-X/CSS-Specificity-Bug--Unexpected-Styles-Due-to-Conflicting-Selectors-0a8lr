The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling behavior when selectors with equal specificity conflict.  For example, consider the following:

```css
.class1 { color: red; }
#id1 .class1 { color: blue; }
```

If an element has both `class1` and `id1`, the rule `#id1 .class1` will win due to higher specificity, resulting in blue text even though `.class1` appears earlier.  This can be hard to debug as the conflicting rules may be far apart in the CSS file or even come from different sources (e.g., imported stylesheets).
