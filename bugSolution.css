One solution is to refactor the CSS to avoid conflicting selectors entirely.  Instead of relying on a specific sequence, ensure each rule has unique enough specificity to resolve it. For instance, add a more specific class or ID to target the desired element precisely.

Another solution is to use `!important` (but it's generally not recommended except in rare cases). By adding it to the specific rule that should take precedence:

```css
.class1 { color: red; }
#id1 .class1 { color: blue !important; }
```
However, overusing `!important` can lead to maintainability issues.

The best practice is to carefully structure your CSS to ensure no conflicting specificity arises.

```css
/* Improved CSS - avoids specificity conflicts */
.class1 { color: red; }
#id1 { .class1 { color: blue; } }
```
